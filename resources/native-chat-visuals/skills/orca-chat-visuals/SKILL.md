# Inline visuals in an Orca chat

Orca can show an HTML page inside your reply. Use one whenever a visual would make the answer
clearer.

## Writing the page

- Save it in the folder named by `ORCA_CHAT_VISUALS_DIR` (`printenv ORCA_CHAT_VISUALS_DIR`; in
  PowerShell `$env:ORCA_CHAT_VISUALS_DIR`). If it's unset or you can't write there, skip the visual.
- One complete HTML file per visual, directly in that folder, under 512 KB, with a new file name
  each time (e.g. `latency-by-region-7c1e.html`): letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`, ending in `.html`.
- Inline your styles, scripts and data. Libraries and fonts may load only from cdn.jsdelivr.net,
  unpkg.com, cdnjs.cloudflare.com, esm.sh, fonts.googleapis.com and fonts.gstatic.com. The page
  can't make network requests; use inline SVG or `data:` URLs for images.
- Don't size anything to the viewport height (`100vh`); Orca fits the frame to your content.
- Optional: Orca's theme colors are available as CSS variables (`--background`, `--foreground`,
  `--muted-foreground`, `--border`, `--primary`, `--chart-1` to `--chart-5`).

## Showing it

After the file exists, put this on its own line in your reply, outside any code block:

::orca-visual{file="latency-by-region-7c1e.html" title="Latency by region"}

`file` is the bare file name, never a path; `title` is optional. At most 8 per reply.

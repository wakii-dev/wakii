/**
 * Runs the layout checks after each scenario step and records which check fired.
 *
 * - rules: the runtime's layout breaks a structural rule (also on transient reads while settling),
 *   or an id changed for the same pane, tab or group since the previous step.
 * - view: what the window draws differs from the runtime's layout.
 * - client: what a paired client / the CLI is told differs from the runtime's layout.
 * - expected: the runtime's layout is not the one the scenario's commands should produce.
 * - restart: the layout after a relaunch (or PTY daemon restart) differs from before it.
 * - marker: text written to a pane's terminal never shows in that pane (a frozen or crossed pane).
 * - remount: a pane's terminal view was created again in the same window outside a restart.
 *
 * Between checkpoints a sampler runs the rules every 100 ms; a breach that heals before the next
 * step is recorded as transient.

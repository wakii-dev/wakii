// What one `agentSession.send` answer means to a client with no outbox.
//
// The desktop reads the same four dispatch states through
// `disposeStructuredAgentSessionSendResult`; mobile has no queue to move, so it
// needs only two facts: the outcome to report, and whether the operation id it
// sent under is spent.
//
// The id is the whole safety mechanism here. Mobile keys its retained ids by
// message body, so re-sending the same text reuses the id — and one id is one
// delivery: `performSend` answers a second request under a recorded id from the
// ledger and never puts it back on the wire. Releasing the id turns that replay
// into a genuine second delivery, which is why only a settled answer releases it:
//
//   accepted/pending — the send happened. The id is spent; a later identical
//     message is a new message and must carry a new id.
//   withdrawn — a submission a Stop took back before the agent started it is
//     drawn in the chat with its stop row, so it spends the id and goes back to no
//     draft. Answering a first send, it is that message: sent, then stopped. As a
//     retained replay it cannot be told from a new send of the same text, and it
//     provably never ran, so the caller sends it again under a fresh id.
//   rejected — a terminal refusal or rejected submission spends a fresh id. A
//     pending-admission refusal, or any refusal after earlier transport doubt,
//     keeps it because neither proves a retained delivery did not happen. Two
//     exceptions spend it anyway, because the host can never accept the replay
//     and keeping the id would only refuse every later send of the same text:
//     a host that refuses the replay's request shape itself (an older host's
//     strict schema turning `delivery` away), and an id the host has expired.
//     A rejection the host kept as a card answers as `queued`: the card holds the text.
//   unknown — the one answer that KEEPS its id, whether it came from the host or
//     from an ack-loss on the way back. The message may be with the provider, so
//     the retry has to stay a replay. Rotating here is what sent one message to a
//     model five times.

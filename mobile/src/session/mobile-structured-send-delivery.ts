// What one `agentSession.send` answer means to a client with no outbox.
//
// The desktop reads the same four dispatch states through
// `disposeStructuredAgentSessionSendResult`; mobile has no queue to move, so it
// needs only two facts: the outcome to report, and whether the operation id it
// sent under is spent.
//
// The id is the whole safety mechanism here. Mobile keys its retained ids by
// message body, so re-sending the same text reuses the id — and one id is one
// delivery: `performSend` answers a second request under a recorded id from the
// ledger and never puts it back on the wire. Releasing the id turns that replay
// into a genuine second delivery, which is why only a settled answer releases it:
//
//   accepted/pending — the send happened. The id is spent; a later identical
//     message is a new message and must carry a new id.
//   rejected — a terminal refusal or rejected submission spends a fresh id. A
//     pending-admission refusal, or any refusal after earlier transport doubt,
//     keeps it because neither proves a retained delivery did not happen. The
//     one exception is a host that refuses the replay's request shape itself
//     (an older host's strict schema turning `delivery` away): that host can
//     never accept the replay, so keeping the id would only refuse every later
//     send of the same text.
//   unknown — the one answer that KEEPS its id, whether it came from the host or
//     from an ack-loss on the way back. The message may be with the provider, so
//     the retry has to stay a replay. Rotating here is what sent one message to a
//     model five times.

 * Web sibling: a route the page renders it takes, and a route it does not it hands back.
 *
 * The page is one document standing in for one screen. Pushing a screen it does not carry would
 * paint expo-router's Unmatched, and re-entering the shell for it would re-execute a multi-megabyte
 * bundle on every tap, so the shell pushes the native screen over the still-mounted view instead
 * and Back reveals the page with nothing reloaded.
 *
 * The three members that leave this document are wrapped and the rest are the router's own: the
 * shell says which routes are the page's, in `init`, and the same answer drives all three. A
 * handoff the shell cannot honour — an older shell that granted no `navigate`, or a target the
 * protocol refuses — falls through to the local router: Unmatched is a worse screen than the one
 * the page is on, but a tap that does nothing at all is worse than both, and the route policy is
 * what keeps that case off a device.
 *
 * Whether the target names a screen that exists is nobody's business here; the shape is all this
 * can check, and C1.7 is where a real route-existence check belongs.

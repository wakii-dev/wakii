/**
 * The one place that answers "should this launch be a structured native chat session?".
 *
 * Both launch surfaces call it. The renderer asks when a user opens an agent tab
 * (`resolveAgentLaunchRoute`); orchestration asks when it dispatches a worker, because the mode is
 * the user's own default rather than a per-call flag. Keeping the two halves — the settings default
 * and the per-launch feasibility — here is what stops the second caller from growing a copy that
 * drifts.

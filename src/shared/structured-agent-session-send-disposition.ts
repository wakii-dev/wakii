// How one send outcome changes the outbox.
//
// The sibling of `reconcileStructuredAgentSessionOutbox`: that one folds the
// journal's view of a submission into the queue, this one folds the answer to a
// single `agentSession.send`. Both write the same state, so they live together
// and speak the same vocabulary. Pure on purpose — the hook that calls this owns
// the refs, the React state and the storage write, and nothing else decides an
// entry's state.

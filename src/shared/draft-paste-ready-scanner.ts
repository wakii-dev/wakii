// analogous to Codex's prompt glyph. It fires ~2s after bracketed paste is
// enabled, so gating on it (instead of a quiet window) stops the paste from
// racing the composer mount under slow/noisy startup. mimo-code uses the same
// signal by parity; the quiet-window fallback covers any agent that differs.
const DECTCEM_SHOW_CURSOR = '\x1b[?25h'
// Why: grok's composer prompt glyph (U+276F), rendered once the input box
// mounts. It is also the default glyph of popular shell prompts (starship,
// pure), so it is anchored on the alternate-screen switch below — the shell
// prompt that precedes the launch command is always in the normal buffer.
// grok swaps it for `> ` on legacy Windows consoles, which is too generic to
// match; those fall back to the quiet window and the caller's hard timeout.
const GROK_COMPOSER_PROMPT = '❯'
// Why: ZCode's composer box top-left corner (U+256D), painted once the input box mounts.
// It is locale-independent — ZCode translates the placeholder and the mode label in the

/**
 * Pure, incremental scanner shared by the renderer and main-process draft-paste
 * readiness waiters so the two delivery paths (desktop-local vs runtime/SSH/
 * remote) cannot drift. It only parses the PTY byte stream; timers, the PTY
 * subscription, and resolution stay with each caller because their transports
 * and return types differ.
 *
 * Per agent signal:
 *   - `codex-composer-prompt`: fullscreen waits for the live footer and composer
 *     cursor at a completed frame; older inline builds keep their glyph signal.
 *   - `render-cursor-after-bracketed-paste`: ready when DECTCEM show-cursor
 *     (`\x1b[?25h`) renders while DECSET 2004 is held; `\x1b[?2004l` revokes it.
 *     Like Codex it does NOT arm the quiet window: opencode stays silent for up
 *     to ~3.9s between enabling bracketed paste and mounting its composer, so a
 *     quiet window would fire during that gap and pre-empt the marker. opencode
 *     re-emits show-cursor on every render frame once mounted, so the marker is
 *     effectively guaranteed; the caller's hard timeout is the backstop if it
 *     never appears.
 *   - `grok-composer-prompt`: ready when grok's `❯` glyph renders after the
 *     alternate-screen switch (`\x1b[?1049h`). grok shimmers its startup logo
 *     until the session opens, so the quiet window alone never settles and the
 *     draft waited out the full hard timeout (~8s). The glyph is anchored on the
 *     alt-screen switch rather than DECSET 2004 because the shell that runs the
 *     launch command emits 2004 too and its own prompt may be `❯` (starship,
 *     pure) — anchoring there could paste into the shell. This is the only
 *     signal with both a marker and a quiet window, and they use DIFFERENT
 *     anchors: grok can render inline (`--no-alt-screen`, `[ui] screen_mode =
 *     "minimal"`) and on legacy Windows consoles draws `> ` instead of `❯`, so
 *     the marker is best-effort and the 2004-anchored quiet window is the floor
 *     that keeps those launches on the pre-existing delivery path. The alt-screen
 *     anchor is revoked on `\x1b[?1049l`: leaving it hands the terminal back to
 *     the shell, so a glyph after that is the shell's prompt, not grok's composer.
 *   - `dsh-composer-prompt`: the grok shape applied to DSH-TUI, whose composer draws the
 *     same `❯` inside the alternate screen. The committed
 *     `dsh-tui-ready-no-key.txt` transcript is the evidence: DECSET 2004 at byte 6,
 *     `\x1b[?1049h` at byte 40, and the first `❯` at byte 5910.
 *   - `zcode-composer-prompt`: ready when ZCode's composer box corner (`╭`) renders
 *     after the alternate-screen switch. ZCode repaints its animated ASCII banner
 *     indefinitely — the captured transcript is still repainting 30s after the composer
 *     mounted — so the quiet window alone never settles and a launch draft would wait out
 *     the whole hard timeout, exactly as grok did. Same alt-screen anchoring and
 *     revocation as grok, because a powerline shell prompt can draw `╭` too.
 *   - `opencode-agent-row`: OpenCode's submit signal (see opencode-agent-row-scanner.ts): the
 *     box's show-cursor as above plus the agent/model row painted directly above the box's
 *     bottom corner. OpenCode 2 draws the box before its agent list loads and drops an Enter
 *     sent in between. No quiet window; while the box shows without the row it asks for a
 *     grace timer (`readyAfterMs`) instead.
 *   - `render-quiet-after-bracketed-paste` (default): no signal marker; arms the
 *     quiet window once DECSET 2004 is seen.
 *
 * A 512-byte ring (`recent` / `postAnchorRecent`) covers escape sequences
 * split across chunk boundaries without retaining terminal scrollback.

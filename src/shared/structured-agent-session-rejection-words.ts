/**
 * What to put on screen for a rejection.
 *
 * A content rejection's reason is the provider explaining itself, so it is shown
 * verbatim — "Claude does not support the image type .bmp" is the whole answer and
 * a generic string would throw it away. A transport rejection's reason is an
 * internal marker; printing it put `provider_write_failed: broken pipe` in front of
 * users, which names nothing they can act on. That case gets copy that says what
 * happened, and on the phone that the message can be sent again — which it can,
 * because the frame provably never left, so a resend cannot duplicate.
 *
 * The null default claims no cause and no next step, because at that point we know
 * neither: all it asserts is the one thing every rejection shares.
 *
 * Exported because the phone needs the same copy: the rule about
 * which reasons a person may read is a property of the reason, not of the queue.

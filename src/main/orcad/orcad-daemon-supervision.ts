/**
 * orcad's half of the supervision contract: it spawns and supervises the terminal daemon.
 *
 * The whole reason the peer model is recommended over an SSH target is that daemon-backed
 * PTYs stay `live` across a runtime restart (docs/reference/ssh-execution-boundary.md).
 * Without a daemon here, every orcad restart, update and rollback is a SIGKILL for every
 * running terminal — on the host whose selling point is that work survives the client going
 * away.
 *
 * The constraint that makes a restart non-destructive lives in `stopWakiidDaemon` below: the
 * daemon is DETACHED and must outlive this process. Anything that tears it down on the way
 * out silently converts a restart back into data loss.

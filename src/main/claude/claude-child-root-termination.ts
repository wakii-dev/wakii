 * Kills the root through the handle Node owns rather than through its pid, which

 * reaps, so the signal either reaches the process Orca spawned or reaches
 * nothing. A probe here could only let an unreadable process table cost the tree
 * the one fallback that still works once every table read has failed.
 *
 * On POSIX the root is the provider supervisor, killed only after its own stop had
 * its whole bound; Claude, in its own group, is reached by the descendant kill.
 *
 * False means no signal was sent, because the root had already left.

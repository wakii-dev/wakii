 * - 'installed': every managed event in ~/.codex/hooks.json has an Wakii entry,
 *   and the frozen ones are trusted by codex itself through the app-server grant.
 * - 'unavailable': the grant lane could not trust the entry (old binary,
 *   unsupported RPC, verify failure), or its retry window is still open. An
 *   entry the attempt wrote that is still untrusted is withdrawn.
 * - 'removed': hooks are off here. Launch prep leaves the real home as it is;
 *   only an explicit opt-out strips Wakii's entry, since other Wakiis share it.

// What a non-text event does, in two parts that never share a clock.
//
// Admission decides from the state (and the journal's rows by key, when bound) whether the event
// is dropped, what it holds open, and how it changes the state; it writes and allocates nothing.
// Each write's resolver decides, when the write runs, what the journal holds then: a resume admits
// events before the sink binds, and the dead-generation sweep lands between admission and the
// write, so every journal-dependent choice is made there.

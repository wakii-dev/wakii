// Making a persisted chat addressable again, for a surface that can no longer see it.
//
// `close` keeps the record and the journal on disk precisely so a session can be attached again;
// what it does not keep is the tab, and a client drops every unpublished `agent-session` tab on
// each session-tabs sync. So a chat the user closed — or one this process has not opened since
// launch — is reachable in Agent Session History by id and by nothing else. This is the lookup that
// turns that id back into something a client can publish.
//
// It is deliberately the whole of what reveal does on the host. It starts no provider child: only
// a send does. And a journal it cannot open is not a refusal — the chat shows that failure with a
// Retry, so the tab is worth publishing either way.

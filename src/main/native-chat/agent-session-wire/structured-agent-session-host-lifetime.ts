// The host's half of a session's lifetime: stopping its agent, and closing its conversation.
//
// Two operations, because they end two different things. Stopping the agent ends the provider
// child and hands the lease back; the conversation — its open journal, its status row and its
// readers — stays, and the next send starts a new child. Closing the conversation drops its
// in-memory fold, a cache the next read or write rebuilds from the host's journal database.
//
// Both are written for a caller already inside the session's serialize: the queue is not
// reentrant, so every public entry point takes it once and calls these.

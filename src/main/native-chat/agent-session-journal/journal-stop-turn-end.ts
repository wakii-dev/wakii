// What a Stop decides about the turn it named: the one rule every turn-end write passes through.

// A turn a person's Stop or close of this chat named, or, when it named none, a turn opened by a
// send it stopped, ending with no verdict of its own after that Stop's event, ends as their
// cancellation. A host stop, an eviction and no Stop at all leave the end as written. It runs
// where each row is built, inside the journal's serialized write, so it reads every Stop folded
// before the end: the adapter's settle, the host's fallback and a relaunch's settle all write
// through it, and every client folds the row it wrote.

// The queue's pauses: a pure function of the journal fold and the cards, never a stored flag, so
// nothing has to retire them. Each holds its own cards (`queuePauseHolding`). In force when:
//   - 'stopped': the latest Stop event is a person's (reason `user-stop`), with no later Resume row
//     and no turn sent after it and accepted. A later Stop of any reason supersedes it; only a
//     person's pauses.
//   - 'cleared': a card named by the latest clear mark waits, with no later accepted turn or Resume.
//   - 'restarted': a card queued before this conversation last opened waits — Orca quit or
//     crashed, or the chat closed, while it waited — and no turn or Resume has happened since the
//     open. The open marks itself with a row when it finds waiting cards (`queueReopen`), so a card
//     queued after it is never mistaken for one from before. Never published: nothing sends by
//     itself, and the next turn (the carry-on or the person's own message) runs first.
// Any accepted turn lifts them, whoever sent it: a person, Orca's own messages, or the queue.
// A card held on its own (`hold_reason`, a failed conversion) is outside every pause: only an
// action on it releases it.

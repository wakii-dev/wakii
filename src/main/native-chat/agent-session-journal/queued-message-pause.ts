// The queue's pauses: a pure function of the journal fold and the cards, never a stored flag, so
// nothing has to retire them. Each holds its own cards (`queuePauseHolding`). In force when:
//   - 'stopped': the latest Stop event is a person's (reason `user-stop`), with no later Resume row
//     and no turn a person asked for sent after it and accepted. A later Stop of any reason
//     supersedes it; only a person's pauses.
//   - 'cleared': a card /clear carried into this conversation waits, and no person's turn or
//     Resume has happened here since.
//   - 'restarted': a waiting card was written by another host process, and no person's turn has
//     started since this conversation opened.
// A person's turn is an accepted submission of origin `client`. Orchestration mail, a restart
// continuation, a launch prompt and the queue's own drain are `host` and never lift it.

// The queue's pauses: a pure function of the journal fold and the cards, never a stored flag, so
// nothing has to retire them. Each holds its own cards (`queuePauseHolding`). In force when:
//   - 'stopped': the latest Stop event is a person's (reason `user-stop`), with no later Resume row
//     and no turn sent after it and accepted. A later Stop of any reason supersedes it; only a
//     person's pauses.
//   - 'cleared': a card /clear carried into this conversation waits, and no turn or Resume has
//     happened here since.
//   - 'restarted': a waiting card with no hold of its own was written by another host process,
//     and no turn has started since this conversation opened. Never published: after a restart
//     nothing sends by itself, and the next turn (the carry-on or the person's own message) runs
//     first.
// Any accepted turn lifts them, whoever sent it: a person, Orca's own messages, or the queue.
// A card held on its own (`hold_reason`) is outside every pause: only an action on it releases it.

// Host-owned draft rows for messages queued while the main agent is working.
//
// A queued message is NOT a journal row: it becomes one — an ordinary
// submission — only when consume converts it, in the same transaction as the
// submission's append. Until then it lives here, `session_id`-keyed so it
// survives epoch rollover and replacement (`journal-row-table.ts` deletes only
// `journal_rows`). After a refusal its text survives as a `returned` row a
// rewind cannot delete — a command refused in its own turn is spent instead, its
// turn's row saying why; after a withdrawal it waits again.

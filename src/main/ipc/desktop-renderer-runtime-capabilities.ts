/**
 * What the desktop renderer advertises when it calls its own main process over `runtime:call`.
 *
 * Main and the renderer ship as one build, so nothing here is about version skew — the renderer
 * arrives as `clientKind: 'runtime'`, not in the `clientKind === undefined` population, so any
 * capability the host uses as an authorization gate has to be named here or the method is refused.
 * That is why this stays a curated set rather than the remote list: several remote-only entries
 * would change local behaviour if adopted (`SESSION_TAB_CLOSE_INTENT` alone would start refusing
 * an unattributed desktop tab close), the lists remain curated for those reasons.
 *
 * One constant, not one list per dispatch path: the unary and streaming handlers held separate
 * copies, and a capability added to one and missed on the other is invisible until a user hits it.

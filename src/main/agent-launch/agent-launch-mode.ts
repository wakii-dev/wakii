/**
 * Which surface a launch gets — a structured chat session or a terminal agent — decided from the
 * user's own settings and the executing host's answer.
 *
 * No caller passes a mode. If the user's default is that a new agent tab opens as a structured
 * native chat, then every launch is one: an orchestration worker, a mobile create, a CLI create,
 * a renderer tab. That default is a preference rather than a demand, so a launch it cannot apply
 * to falls back to a PTY terminal and the receipt says which mode ran and why — a routine launch
 * must never fail because the user happens to have a chat preference on.
 *
 * The settings default and the per-launch feasibility both come from
 * `shared/structured-native-chat-launch-route`. This module supplies placement facts and formats
 * the receipt; it does not own a second feasibility policy.
 *
 * Callers differ only in what they call the thing being started, so the receipt's noun is
 * parameterized. Orchestration says "worker" because its receipts are read alongside dispatch
 * records; every other surface says "chat session" / "terminal agent".

/**
 * What a pane may do when an `agent.launch` showed it before its agent existed.
 *
 * Derived on every spawn. While the launch's fate is open, the launch record (the operation ledger)
 * names the launch that owns the pane and how it ended; the runtime, and the pane's persisted
 * binding, say whether a process holds it. Once the fate is final for the pane, the tab itself keeps
 * it (`agentLaunchPane.outcome`) for the tab's life, so the pane no longer reads the record. The one
 * in-memory fact is a launch still running in this process, which dies with that launch. Its pane
 * attaches as soon as its agent runs; a user's close of its tab or pane, committed to main, stops it.

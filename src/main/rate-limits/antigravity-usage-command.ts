 * Why print mode and not an HTTP call: agy keeps its Google credential in the OS keyring and mints
 * its own access token against `daily-cloudcode-pa`, so nothing outside agy can authenticate the
 * quota endpoint. Verified on agy 1.2.11: the call spends no quota and starts no conversation
 * (`num_turns: 0`, every token counter 0, empty `conversation_id`).
 *
 * `/usage` over `/quota`: both resolve to the same `usage` command, and `/usage` is the spelling agy
 * lists in its own help.

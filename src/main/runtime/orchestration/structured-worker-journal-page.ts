/**
 * The one tail read every structured-journal reader shares.
 *
 * `worker-read`, the release archive and `terminal read` all want the same thing — the newest page
 * of a session's reduced timeline, and `null` rather than a throw when the session is not attached.
 * It lives here so none of them can drift onto a different page size or a different failure shape.
 *
 * Each reads the worker's own conversation: the newest page of its OWN rows, windowed before the
 * limit so a subagent's burst cannot crowd them out. A subagent's rows are that subagent's, and a
 * reader of the worker must never take them for the worker's words; the worker's spawn roster,
 * which stays, is the one line that says a subagent ran.

/**
 * Structured workers as group-address recipients.
 *
 * `@all` and its siblings resolve recipients from `listTerminals`, which enumerates leaves and
 * PTYs — so a structured worker was never a candidate. Worse, the exclusion happened BEFORE
 * per-recipient resolution, so the `SendRecipientWarning` machinery never ran and the caller got
 * exit 0 plus a receipt naming only the workers that did resolve. A broadcast "stop work" reached
 * the PTY workers and silently missed the structured ones.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT solved by teaching `listTerminals` about structured sessions: that result is
 * published to paired mobile and remote clients and to every consumer that assumes a summary has a
 * `ptyId` or is writable, so it is its own change under
 * `docs/reference/remote-wire-compatibility.md`. Group addressing needs three fields, and
 * `RuntimeTerminalSummary` already satisfies them structurally — so the group resolver widens to
 * the smaller shape instead, and nothing here has to invent a `worktreePath` or a `branch`.

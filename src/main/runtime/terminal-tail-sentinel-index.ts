 * Which retained tail lines match the wait-blocked sentinel, memoized per

 *
 * Why: `computeTerminalTailWaitState` must prove the ABSENCE of a signal, so it
 * cannot early-exit and re-tested all 2000 retained lines on every scan (20/s
 * per streaming PTY) even though only ~20 lines were new. Keyed weakly by the
 * array so an entry dies with the tail it describes; the tail array is replaced
 * on every append and never mutated in place, so at most one entry per PTY
 * stays live. Each entry keeps the sentinel it was scanned with: a rules hot reload swaps it, and
 * matches found by the old one would hide a blocker only the new one knows.

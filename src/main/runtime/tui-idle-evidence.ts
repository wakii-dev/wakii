/**
 * Ranking the evidence that a `tui-idle` wait may settle on.
 *
 * Why a ranking: a thinking TUI and a finished TUI are both silent, so the absence
 * of a working marker can never prove completion. `detectAgentStatusFromTitle`
 * DEFAULTS a name-only agent title to `idle` — the sidebar needs that to clear a
 * stale spinner (#1437) — so a busy Codex/Devin pane is routinely titled idle, and
 * accepting it satisfied a wait in ~0s mid-turn (#6011).
 *
 *   0. HOOKS — for an agent whose hooks are authoritative (agent-state-rules/ profile), a fresh
 *      hook row for the main agent's turn: done, working, or a permission wait, with the tail's
 *      blocked text judged by the permission arbiter against it (tui-idle-hook-lane.ts).
 *   0b. BLOCKED — otherwise, the tail shows a prompt waiting on the user.
 *   1. STRONG READY — the agent states it is ready: an explicit idle marker in its own
 *      title, or a known ready-prompt body.
 *   1b. QUIET READY SCREEN — Muse titles no rest signal, and agents whose rules
 *      (agent-state-rules/) read a ready screen or text they also paint mid-turn (Codex's
 *      header and composer), so that body is believed only once quiet. OMP's own idle title is
 *      believed once it has stood that long, because it paints that title before its setup
 *      wizard opens.
 *   2. WORKING — a fresh first-party agent status (OSC 9999) saying working/blocked/
 *      waiting, or a working title. The agent's own account of itself outranks anything
 *      inferred.
 *   3. WEAK READY — a name-only title, or a quiet non-shell foreground process. A last
 *      resort, and only once sustained.
 *
 * Why weak ready is a verdict class rather than a per-evidence flag: none of it can see a
 * start-up dialog the line tail lost (Claude's workspace trust), so ONLY the poll may settle
 * on it, after the rendered screen shows no blocker. Synchronous sites settle on tiers 0-1b.
 *
 * Over every ready tier: a screen veto (OMP's setup wizard) refuses input whichever lane settled.
 *
 * Why derived here rather than stamped onto the record at write time: `syncWindowGraph`
 * rebuilds every leaf from an explicit field list, so a bespoke provenance field is
 * silently dropped on any renderer publish and the verdict silently flips. `lastOscTitle`
 * is copied, so reading the rank back off it cannot decay.

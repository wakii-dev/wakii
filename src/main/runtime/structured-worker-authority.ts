/**
 * Resolves a structured worker handle to the same authority facts a live PTY supplies.

 * The registry holds the handle→session mapping for this process; the durable worker-terminal
 * resource row is what survives a restart, so a miss falls back to rehydrating from it. The
 * durable agent-session record, the chat's tab and the orchestration's own resource row decide
 * custody: see `structured-worker-custody`.
 * Whether its provider process runs is a separate fact, `observeStructuredWorker`, and routing
 * never reads it — an agent at rest still receives mail, which starts it.
 *
 * A worker is addressed by the session minted for it, its conversation id; a `/clear` continues the
 * conversation in a successor session. Every worker-level answer here resolves the session RUNNING
 * the worker now through `structuredWorkerSession`; only per-session callers name one directly.

// The process's one durable agent-session record store, opened on its own.
//
// The launch ledger lives in this store, and admitting a launch is the first thing every replay-safe
// `agent.launch` does — a terminal launch included. Reaching the store used to mean installing the
// whole chat host (provider adapters, the host, the model catalog) first. The store is opened here
// instead and the chat host, when something needs it, is built on this same instance: the store is
// a single writer, so a second copy of it would diverge.
//
// Known edges, both reachable only once quit has begun (stop has no other production caller): a
// stop whose host teardown fails empties the slot while that host still holds its store open, so a
// later admission would open a second one; and a store opened after stop is closed by nothing but
// process exit.

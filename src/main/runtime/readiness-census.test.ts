/**
 * The readiness census (STA-9098): today's tui-idle verdicts, pinned so a refactor of the readiness
 * rules can prove it changed none of them.
 *
 * - Transcripts (readiness-census-transcripts-<shard>.test.ts): every recorded agent PTY transcript
 *   is replayed chunk by chunk into a real runtime pane at its recorded grid, once with the agent
 *   known and once agent-unknown. Each frame records the ranked verdict the moment the chunk lands
 *   and had the stream then gone quiet, what `terminal wait --for tui-idle` started there returns
 *   (at once or on its first poll tick), and the same on a clockless (restored or adopted) pane.
 * - Synthetic (readiness-census-synthetic.test.ts): every TuiAgent under a bounded matrix of title,
 *   first-party status, screen, foreground process and output clock
 *   (readiness-census-synthetic-matrix.ts says which cross-product and why).
 *
 * Baselines live in __fixtures__/readiness-census/, one per replayed pane (run-length encoded per
 * frame) or agent. Any difference fails with the subject and frames or cases that changed. If the change is intended, regenerate with
 *
 *   UPDATE_READINESS_CENSUS=1 pnpm test src/main/runtime/readiness-census
 *
 * and review the JSON diff (the commit hook's oxfmt pass reflows it; the census only parses it).

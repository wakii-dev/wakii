// How provider lifecycle events reach the host, and how teardown knows every one has landed.
//
// Exit recovery runs on one chain so teardown can drain it: exit callbacks arrive from child
// process tasks, and a fire-and-forget one could otherwise append after the host flushed and
// removed its journal directory. That chain orders nothing across sessions, and a recovery on it
// can run a whole reacquisition, so `started` stays off it: it takes only its own session's
// serialized step, and is tracked here so the same drain still waits for it.

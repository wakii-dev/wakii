/**
 * The tab of an `agent.launch`, shown before the launch is admitted.
 *
 * Admission, workspace resolution, the mode decision and the daemon spawn each have a cold cost (a
 * Windows window still booting its first PowerShell measured ~0.55 s and ~1 s), and the tab used to
 * wait for all of them. It now waits for none: the host asks the window for the tab first, under ids
 * the spawn will bake into the agent's PTY, and the pane attaches to that process when it exists.
 *
 * Only a launch with an operation id gets one: the launch record is what tells the pane, then and
 * after a restart, which launch owns it and how it ended (`agent-launch-pane-attachment`).
 *
 * Best-effort by construction. Anything this cannot decide cheaply — a workspace it cannot resolve,
 * a chat-mode default, no window owning the layout, a pane already running something — skips the
 * early tab, and the launch's tab appears when it spawns, exactly as before.

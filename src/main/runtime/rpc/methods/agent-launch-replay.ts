/**
 * Durable admission for `agent.launch`.
 *
 * The contract this enforces is three sentences: an operation runs at most once, a replay returns
 * the recorded answer, and an operation whose outcome is unknown is refused. Everything else a lost
 * launch might want — finding the workspace a dead attempt left behind, adopting a half-created
 * session, finishing an interrupted publication — is recovery, and none of it is here. Recovery
 * makes a stranded user whole; this makes a retry harmless, and the two are bought separately.
 *
 * The order is the inverse of what the handler did before. Admission comes first, ahead of
 * resolving the caller's worktree selector, because a selector resolution is a live precondition
 * and a replay must not be able to fail on one: an operation that already ran has an answer, and
 * re-deciding it against today's world is how a recorded success becomes a fresh refusal the client
 * then retries as a second effect. `admitAgentSessionMutation` puts the ledger ahead of the writer
 * lease for that same reason.

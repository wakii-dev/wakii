/**
 * Host-side delivery of a launch's initial text to the terminal agent the launch just started.
 *
 * The twin of `agent-launch-structured-prompt`, and it exists for the same reason: `agent.launch`
 * created a terminal and reported the text as undelivered, which was only workable while the
 * surface that could paste — the desktop renderer's own pane — was also the one issuing the launch.
 * Mobile, the CLI and orchestration got an agent and no prompt. The host owns the PTY, so it can
 * write into one whether or not any window is open on it.
 *
 * This is the half the launch command cannot serve. An argv agent's prompt rides that command when
 * its typed line can carry it (`startup-line-prompt-carry`), and then no readiness race exists. What
 * reaches here is a `stdin-after-start` agent, whose CLI accepts no such argument; a prompt too long
 * or multi-line for the typed line; and a reused terminal, whose process was already running before
 * this launch existed. Readiness is `waitForLaunchedAgentComposer`, the one the worker start uses.
 *
 * Nothing here writes to a PTY itself. `sendTerminalAgentPrompt` is the runtime's one agent-prompt
 * writer: it frames the text as a bracketed paste so multi-line and special-character content is
 * not read as keystrokes, serializes concurrent submissions per PTY, pins the lifecycle generation
 * so a respawn cannot inherit the previous incarnation's text, and applies the per-agent submit
 * timing. It routes to local, WSL and SSH transports alike. Orchestration's worker dispatch
 * delivers a preamble through exactly this pair of calls.

 * resend under `not-delivered`, but it cannot un-create a workspace.
 *
 * A stalled submission is deliberately `true`. The stall is raised by the verifier that runs AFTER
 * the write, so it proves only that a turn start went unobserved, never that the paste is missing.
 * Reporting it as undelivered would invite a resend that pastes the whole prompt a second time into
 * an agent already working on it — the failure `coordinator-task-dispatch` documents at its own
 * send. Here the usual preference flips: under-claiming normally costs one wasted resend, but a
 * resend into a live TUI costs a duplicate turn.

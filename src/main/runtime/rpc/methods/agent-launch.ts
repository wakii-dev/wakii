/**
 * `agent.launch` — the one method that starts an agent, whatever surface it turns out to be.
 *
 * It exists because the routing decision had no host-side home: `worktree.create` never consulted
 * it, so any client that created a worktree with `startupAgent` got a PTY agent no matter what the
 * user's default said. That is not fixable inside `worktree.create`, because its contract is
 * exactly "spawn a PTY agent and hand me its `agentTerminalHandle`" — a host that quietly answered
 * it with a structured session would hand every older client a response with no handle and no
 * error. So `worktree.create` keeps that meaning verbatim, forever, and everything that has to
 * choose a surface comes here instead, behind a negotiated capability.
 *
 * A caller therefore never asks for a mode, and must read `outcome.kind` rather than assume one:
 * the receipt always says which surface ran and why, so a downgrade is never silent.
 *
 * A launch is also the one call whose retry is most expensive to get wrong — a lost reply means the
 * caller cannot tell "never ran" from "ran, answer lost" — so a caller may name the operation with
 * `operationId` and get exactly one execution, a recorded answer on every replay, and a refusal
 * when the outcome is genuinely unknown. That guarantee is safety, not recovery: it makes a retry
 * harmless, and does nothing to reunite a caller with a surface a dead attempt left behind.

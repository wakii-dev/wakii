// `agentSession.subscribeTurnCompletions` — every structured turn that settles from now on, and,
// for a client that asks with `includePrompts`, every approval or question newly put to the user.
//
// Separate from `agentSession.subscribeStatus` because it answers a different question. Status is
// state a late subscriber still needs, so that stream opens with a snapshot of every session. A
// completion is an edge that has already passed, so this one opens with nothing and replays
// nothing: a client that was away during a completion has missed it, by decision.

// Every agent-session store mutation: draft the published state, apply, check and write exactly the
// changed rows in one journal transaction, then publish the draft. A throw anywhere discards the
// draft, so memory never holds a change the database does not.
//
// Why a promise queue although the body is synchronous: a store call must never run its BEGIN in
// the caller's frame. A caller inside an open journal transaction on the same connection would nest
// a BEGIN, which `runJournalTransaction` does not support. The queue also keeps the FIFO order and
// the async boundary every awaiting caller was written against.

 * Which installed orcad is the live one, and which one a rollback goes back to.

 * runs. Without this record, "roll back" means "deploy the old version again" — which needs
 * the client that has those bytes, on a host that may be the only thing still working. The
 * record is the host-side half: it names an active version, a rollback target, and the
 * pre-activation state snapshot that makes going back to that target sound.
 *
 * It lives beside the version dirs (`~/.orca-remote/orcad-active.json`), not inside one,
 * because it has to outlive whichever version GC removes.

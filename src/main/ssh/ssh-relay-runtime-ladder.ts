/**
 * The design D6 fallback ladder for the relay runtime, as data plus a pure step function:
 *
 *   A       Orca's pinned Node + slot prebuilds
 *   B       a compat pinned Node + compat addons (chosen only when a compat runtime exists)
 *   C       the host's Node >= 18 + Orca's N-API prebuilds, no npm
 *   legacy  the host's Node + npm install, unsupported; the only rung when the user opts in
 *   D       nothing runs: plain SSH terminals and SFTP, recording the classified reason
 *
 * The ladder steps down on a classified refusal (a `PinnedRelayFallbackError`), including an
 * answered host failure the deploy wraps as `install_failed`; an unverifiable probe or self-test
 * throws and the next connect retries the same rung.

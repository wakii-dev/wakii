/**
 * Decommissioning a managed orcad: stop its active instance and record that nothing serves.
 *
 * Runs under the activation fence and journal, so an interrupted decommission recovers like an
 * activation does. It refuses while the terminal census says terminals are live or cannot be
 * counted, and it never signals: the instance-bound request reaches only the orcad it names.
 * Only proven exit deactivates the record; anything less withdraws the request or keeps the
 * fence. Windows runs the same steps: the request is a staged file and exit proof is orcad's own.

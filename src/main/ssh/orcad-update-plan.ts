/**
 * When an update may restart orcad, and when going back is still sound.
 *
 * Two constraints shape everything here.
 *
 * **The daemon must outlive the restart.** orcad forks the terminal daemon and deliberately
 * does not kill it on stop (`orcad-daemon-supervision.ts` uses `disconnectDaemon`, never
 * `shutdownDaemon`). An update that killed it would destroy every terminal on the host —
 * the thing the daemon exists to prevent. After an update the surviving daemon was forked
 * from the OUTGOING bundle, so `daemon-init` sees an entry-path/version mismatch and takes
 * its `shouldPreserveDaemonWithLiveSessions` branch: with live sessions it preserves the old
 * daemon; at exactly zero it replaces it. Both are correct, and both mean the outgoing
 * version's directory is still load-bearing.
 *
 * **The state root is shared across versions.** `~/.orca/` (or `$ORCA_USER_DATA`) is outside
 * every version dir, and Orca's persisted state carries no schema version — migrations run
 * on load and rewrite in place. So "is the old version able to read what the new one wrote"
 * has no answer that can be computed. That is why rollback is defined against a
 * pre-activation snapshot rather than against a version comparison.

/**
 * orcad's garbage collection, and who owns it (design D10; to be tracked in
 * docs/reference/remote-server-install-model.md).
 *
 * **Each model GCs only its own namespace.** orcad removes `orcad-<v>/` directories; the relay
 * removes `relay-<v>/` directories; neither ever removes the other's. The converged server's
 * migration sweep takes over legacy directories only in the release after it has listed them
 * as diagnostics, and only on an `exited` verdict. A pass that deleted the sibling's tree
 * would be reaching across the execution boundary the whole design exists to keep intact.
 *
 * On top of the ownership rule, orcad pins three directories that are idle-looking but
 * load-bearing: the active version, the rollback target, and whichever version the LIVE
 * terminal daemon was forked from.

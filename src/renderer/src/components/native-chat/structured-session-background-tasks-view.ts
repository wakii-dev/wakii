// The background-tasks strip's view of one session's wire state.
//
// The strip reports work that is IN FLIGHT, whether or not it outlived a turn:
// a fan-out's children keep reporting long after the parent settles, and a
// foreground fan-out is running work while the turn is still open. It stays
// mounted through a running turn — turn state is not a filter on the rows,
// because the producers publish only tasks they still have live evidence for.
// A host that publishes its child records sends the running ones only, and no
// roster once none runs, so the strip hides. Only an idle session with live
// work lets the strip animate or speak for itself.

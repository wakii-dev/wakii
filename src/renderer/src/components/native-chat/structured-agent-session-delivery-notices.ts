// Which of the structured chat's own messages say, on their row, that they did not go through.
//
// Derived from the outbox on every render and never stored: each failed or held message carries
// its own typed failure, so each row words its own reason. Read through the drain's own rule: while
// the queue is stopped, the message it stopped on and any failed one ahead of it have a Retry, as
// each would go out at once; one behind it would wait unseen. One waiting behind says nothing; a
// rejected or refused message holds nothing up, so it keeps its words and gets its Retry once the
// queue moves.
//
// A message the host recorded and then rejected is worded from the journal's own fact, found by id;
// the message keeps only a smaller copy, read when its submission is not loaded. A rejection that
// is a failed start's, the fact its loaded row states, says only that it was not sent: the row
// already says why.

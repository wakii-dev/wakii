// Which of the structured chat's own messages say, on their row, that they did not go through, and
// which say quietly that they are still sending: every other one, until the host holds a row that
// has it (pending or accepted). A row in doubt does not, so a message resent over one still reads
// as sending; a rejected row makes it the host's, shown as not sent.
//
// Derived from the outbox on every render and never stored: each failed or held message carries
// its own typed failure, so each row words its own reason. Read through the drain's own rule: while
// the queue is stopped, the message it stopped on and any failed one ahead of it have a Retry, as
// each would go out at once; one behind it would wait unseen. One waiting behind has no failure of
// its own, so it reads as sending; a rejected or refused message holds nothing up, so it keeps its
// words and gets its Retry once the queue moves.
//
// A message the host recorded and then rejected is drawn from the host's history, worded from the
// journal's own fact, with no Retry: sending it again is a new message. A rejection that is a
// failed start's, the fact its loaded row states, says only that it was not sent: the row already
// says why. Until its row loads, the outbox draws it from its smaller copy, which leaves on the batch
// or page that loads the row.

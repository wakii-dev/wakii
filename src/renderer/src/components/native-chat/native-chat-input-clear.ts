// start from an empty line so a prior cancelled paste cannot glue onto the next
// prompt. Not used on verified option commands — model-switch confirmation
// observes the PTY and Ctrl+U can miss confirmation markers.
//
// One Ctrl+U only ever clears ONE logical line. When the line may hold an
// injected multi-line launch draft, callers pass `clearInput` built by
// buildAgentTuiClearInputForText — see agent-tui-input-clear.ts for the measured
// 2N-1 law and the sequences that do NOT work.

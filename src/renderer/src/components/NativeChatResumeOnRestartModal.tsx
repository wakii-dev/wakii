/**
 * What would be resumed, shown before anything runs.
 *
 * Resuming reattaches a chat AND asks the agent to carry on, so the list is the point: the user
 * sees which chats the last teardown recorded as mid-turn before a message goes anywhere. Every
 * string here has to say that a message is sent and that the user's own prompt is not re-sent.
 *
 * The "don't ask again" box removes the PROMPT, never a safety check — an opted-in launch calls
 * the same RPC, which re-derives the same predicate and staggers the same way.
 *
 * Resume closes the dialog at once and the status-bar entry carries the run, then any chat it could
 * not carry on. The run lives in the store, as a skill update's does, so the dialog is one view of it.
 *
 * A chat an earlier resume could not carry on is listed too, as the same row plus what went wrong
 * and what to do; selecting it and resuming is a retry, unless the host says a retry cannot run.
 * Row actions (Retry, Dismiss) act on their row and leave the dialog open. It closes only on the
 * user's own way out, or once the host confirms nothing is left; a resume settling never closes it.
 *
 * Closing is a SNOOZE, so looking around before deciding cannot remove the recovery. Dismiss all is
 * the explicit path that deletes the durable records.
